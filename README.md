# DevWellOpenSource
An open source project for creating and sharing coding learning resources.

## There are topics.
## Topics have courses.
## Courses have:
- a sensible name that is descriptive and applies to the topic it is inside. E.g. 'Getting Started with HTML and CSS' or 'Building a Card Component'.
- a project for students to build.
- clearly defined acceptance criteria for that project that are laid out at the top of each lesson.
- lessons that guide students towards building a solution that meets the acceptance criteria.
- a folder called `Gallery` where users can submit their own work for public consumption via pull requests.

## Lessons have:
- a numbered title, e.g. Lesson 01, etc.
- a `lesson.md` file where the lesson content lives.
- a `lessonInfo.json` file that has the title of the lesson, as well as a description and a quiz.
- a folder called `images` that contains any images required for the `lesson.md` file.

## Quizzes have:
- at least 5 questions based on the lesson content
- multiple choice or input based questions
