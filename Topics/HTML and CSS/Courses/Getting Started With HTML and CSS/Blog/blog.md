# Starting From Zero - How To Begin Your Journey Towards Becoming A Software Developer

In the summer of 2016, I wrote my first line of code.
In the summer of 2017, I was hired by one of the biggest software companies in the UK as a mid-level developer.

Now, I'm not saying it was easy, just demonstrating that it's possible.

So, looking back, this is the path I took and the things that I believe helped me to land that first job.

## Learning to Code

This is how I divide up my experience of 'learning to code' (quotation marks very intentional there...)

*Stage 1 - Everything is hard! I have no idea what I'm doing! I think I'm making progress but I'm confused all the time!*

This confusion is a good thing. It means you're being pushed outside of your comfort zone. As long as you have a clear project to work on that allows you judge whether you are making some/any progress, then don't worry about the uncomfortable feeling you carry around all the time. I mean, it's literally called being 'outside of your comfort zone'.

A key part here is having someone to go to when you get stuck. And you will get stuck. A lot. And the problem will almost certainly be a comma. Or a semi-colon. You will spend hours, convinced that you've written perfect code and that everything is unfair. And then you'll see it. Or, the person you go to for support will see it for you. So, whether it's a friend, a mentor at a code school, or whoever can fulfill that role, getting access to some outside assistance will help you through the dark(er) times.

*Stage 2*

- Learn by doing. Don't worry about theory. Unless you find it interesting.
- CS is not all that.
- Portfolio!

- Use good tooling to help you. Prettier, Eslint.
- Google!
- Make projects that are bite sized to help you learn things. Don't think you have to study first before making stuff.
